# P3D_LandingLightEffectUpd
A simplest update to your old fx_landing.fx utilizing latest Dynamic Lighting Technology in Prepar3Dv4, V5.
no need to close source since it's "Modifiable", Use in any project is very welcome.


Wait, in P3Dv4, replacing fx_landing.fx is not working, so please rename it to something else, then call this effect in your project as needed.
